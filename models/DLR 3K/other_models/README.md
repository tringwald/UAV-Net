For Mobilenet models you will need to follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/yonghenglh6/DepthwiseConvolution) to setup the depthwise layer.
For Shufflenet you will need to setup the [ShuffleChannel layer](https://github.com/farmingyard/ShuffleNet).
All other models should work with a default [Caffe-SSD](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd) installation.
